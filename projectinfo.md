## Current Project Standing

#### some noteworthy data we have readily available access to so far:

* bitrate (TCP and UDP)
* signal quality
* signal level dBm
* channels
* frequency (2.4, 5) 

#### Objective
Heatmapping bitrate and quality will be the primary goals. Looks like there
may have to be a GUI wrapper implemented for this as well. Possibly touch display 
for interacting with the map overlay. Arg. Cross that bridge when we get to it.
